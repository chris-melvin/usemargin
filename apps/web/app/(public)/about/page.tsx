            ledgr is built for Filipinos who want to take control of their finances without the

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Too many budgeting apps make you feel guilty when you overspend in a category. They're
            rigid, punishing, and designed for people who already have their finances figured out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>ledgr is different.</strong> We believe budgeting should give you freedom,
            not restriction. Our mission is to give every Filipino one simple number each day:{" "}
            <em>"Here's what you can safely spend today."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            No guilt. No judgment. Just clarity.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional budgeting apps ask you to divide your money into categories (groceries,
            transportation, entertainment). But life doesn't work that way:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You overspend on groceries one week, and suddenly feel like you've "failed"</li>
            <li>You underspend on transportation, but can't easily use that money elsewhere</li>
            <li>Monthly budgets don't help you answer: "Can I afford this coffee right now?"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>The result?</strong> You abandon the budget, feel guilty, and go back to winging
            it.
          </p>

          <h2>How ledgr Works</h2>
          <p>
            ledgr takes a different approach: <strong>daily allowance budgeting</strong>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Tell us your income and bills:</strong> We calculate how much you have left
              after fixed expenses
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get your daily allowance:</strong> We divide your remaining money by the
              number of days left in the month
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spend freely within your daily limit:</strong> No categories, no guilt—just
              one number to guide you
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Auto-rebalance every day:</strong> Overspent today? Tomorrow's budget adjusts
              automatically. Underspent? You get a little extra tomorrow.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It's budgeting that works <em>with</em> you, not against you.
          </p>

          <h2>Built for Filipinos</h2>
          <p>
            ledgr was designed specifically for the Philippine market:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Completely free:</strong> All features are available at no cost, no hidden
              fees or surprise charges
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paycheck-to-paycheck friendly:</strong> Most budgeting advice assumes you have
              savings. We meet you where you are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile-first:</strong> Track expenses on the go, right when you spend
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Natural language input:</strong> Just type "coffee 150 and grab 80" instead of
              filling out forms
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Features</h2>

          <h3>Daily Spending Clarity</h3>
          <p>
            Wake up every day knowing exactly how much you can spend. No math, no guesswork—just
            open the app and see your number.
          </p>

          <h3>Auto-Rebalancing</h3>
          <p>
            Life happens. When you overspend, ledgr automatically adjusts tomorrow's budget. No
            guilt, no lectures—just a gentle nudge to balance things out.
          </p>

          <h3>Flex Bucket</h3>
          <p>
            Want to save for something big (a new phone, a weekend trip) without feeling guilty
            about "splurging"? The Flex Bucket lets you set aside money for larger purchases
            separately from your daily spend.
          </p>

          <h3>Calendar View</h3>
          <p>
            See your entire month at a glance. Color-coded days show you when you overspent (red),
            stayed on track (green), or had a light spending day. Patterns become obvious.
          </p>

          <h3>Income & Bills Tracking</h3>
          <p>
            Log your salary, side income, and freelance gigs. Mark bills as paid. ledgr factors
            everything into your daily allowance automatically.
          </p>

          <h3>Debt Snowball</h3>
          <p>
            Paying off debt? ledgr helps you allocate payments and track progress using the
            proven debt snowball method.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced visualizations: cash flow diagrams, spending trends, category breakdowns, and
            more. See exactly where your money goes.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Paycheck-to-paycheck earners</strong> who need daily clarity, not monthly
              plans

          <h2>Our Values</h2>

          <h3>Freedom Over Restriction</h3>
          <p>
            Budgeting should expand your choices, not limit them. We help you make informed
            decisions, not feel restricted.
          </p>

          <h3>Clarity Over Complexity</h3>
          <p>
            One number. That's all you need to know each day. No complicated spreadsheets, no
            20-category breakdowns.
          </p>

          <h3>Progress Over Perfection</h3>
          <p>
            You won't get it right every day, and that's okay. ledgr focuses on trends and
            progress, not perfect execution.
          </p>
