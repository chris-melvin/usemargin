## Vision

usemargin is a calendar-first financial planner that treats money as a fluid resource. Instead of rigid monthly budgets that punish you for one bad day, usemargin dynamically rebalances your spending across days—giving you clarity, flexibility, and peace of mind.

**One sentence:** *Know exactly what you can spend today, every day.*

---

## 1. Product Philosophy: "Freedom through Logic"

Most budgeting apps fail because they feel like punishment. usemargin is built on three pillars:

| Pillar | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Fresh Starts** | Every day is a new cell on the calendar. Overspending today doesn't "fail" the month—it simply rebalances tomorrow. No guilt, just math. |
| **The Marginalia Aesthetic** | Clean, neutral design with premium typography. The UI feels like a high-end paper planner, reducing the anxiety of looking at finances. |
| **Autonomous Buckets** | The "Flex Bucket" allows guilt-free spending on big-ticket items without breaking your daily rhythm. |

## 2. Who Is usemargin For?

usemargin is designed to serve **anyone who wants a simpler, less stressful relationship with money**—from first-time budgeters to seasoned financial planners.

### Target Segments

| Segment | Pain Point | How usemargin Helps |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Paycheck-to-Paycheck Earners** *(Initial GTM Focus)* | Monthly budgets fail them; they need daily clarity | Daily allowance + auto-rebalancing removes the mental math |
| **Freelancers & Gig Workers** | Irregular income makes traditional budgets impossible | Flexible income tracking + dynamic daily limits adapt to cash flow |
| **Young Professionals** | Want to save but hate spreadsheets | Beautiful UI + 3-second logging makes it feel effortless |
| **Couples & Families** | Need shared visibility without conflict | Shared calendars + individual flex buckets maintain autonomy |
| **Debt Reducers** | Overwhelmed by multiple payments | Debt pips + snowball visualization keep them motivated |
| **Savers & Investors** | Want to optimize surplus allocation | Strategy Coach identifies "low-spend" days for auto-investing |

### Initial Go-To-Market Strategy

**Primary Target:** Young urban professionals (25-35) living paycheck-to-paycheck or week-to-week, who find monthly spreadsheets overwhelming.

**Why start here:**
- Highest pain intensity (daily financial anxiety)
- Underserved by existing apps (Mint, YNAB focus on monthly)
- Strong word-of-mouth potential (shared struggle)
- Lower CAC via social/community channels

**Expansion path:** Once product-market fit is proven, expand horizontally to adjacent segments.

### The Python AI Backend

The backend handles:

- **NLP Processing:** Parsing complex strings like "Spent 500 on dinner and 200 on drinks" using Gemini.
- **Forecasting:** Using pandas to calculate "Burn Rate" and predicting when the Flex Bucket will run dry.
- **Strategic Rebalancing:** Moving beyond simple division to suggest rebalancing based on historical "low-spend" days.

---

## 4. Core Logic Engines

### A. The Daily Allowance Calculation

The "Safe-to-Spend" number for any given day ($D_{rem}$) is calculated as:

$$D_{rem} = (D_{base} + F_{inj}) - E_{day} - D_{day}$$

Where:
- **$D_{base}$**: Default daily limit (e.g., ₱300 / $20)
- **$F_{inj}$**: Injections from the Flex Bucket
- **$E_{day}$**: Total expenses logged for that day
- **$D_{day}$**: Mandatory debt payments due on that day

### B. Waterflow Rebalancing

When $E_{day} > (D_{base} + F_{inj})$, the system triggers a rebalance:

- **UI Action:** The day turns Rose (Red)
- **Logical Action:** The deficit is subtracted from the "Weekly Total," effectively lowering $D_{base}$ for subsequent days until reconciled

## 5. Key Feature Set

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Flex Bucket** | A reserve pool that sits outside daily limits. Users "inject" funds into specific days for luxuries or emergencies. |
| **Income Pips** | Visual indicators on the calendar showing when income arrives—"Financial High Tide" visualization. |
| **Smart Entry** | Natural language input powered by Gemini. Say "coffee 150 and grab 80" and it logs both instantly. |
| **Strategy Coach** | Weekly AI analysis that reads calendar data to suggest when to be frugal and when to indulge. |
| **Quick Templates** | One-tap buttons for repetitive daily costs (Coffee, Commute, Lunch). |
| **Multi-Currency** | Support for multiple currencies with real-time conversion (critical for international expansion). |
| **Shared Calendars** | Couples/families can share a calendar while maintaining individual flex buckets. |
